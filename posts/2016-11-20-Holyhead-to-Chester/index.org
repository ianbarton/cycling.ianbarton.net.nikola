It's possible to ride this route in a day. I have described it in two
sections: Holyhead to Llandudno and Llandudno to Chester. Most people
start the ride in Holyhead, as you will usually have the prevailing
wind behind you. You can leave your car at either Holyhead or Chester
and then catch the train back to your starting point. If part of the
way along you decide that doing the whole ride in one day is too much,
there are several stations where you can catch the train back to the
start.

If you start at Holyhead there is a free car park at Penrhos Beach.
