I first learnt to cycle on two wheels when I was four and a half. I had a bike with
stabiliser wheels on the sides. I remember going to somewhere that had a big
lawn with some older children. We took the stabilisers off my rear wheels,
somebody held me upright and gave me a shove and I was off.

My earliest cycling memory is me on a trike in a friend's garden at their
birthday party. I managed to cycle into their pond and have memories of water
lilies going past me as I sank. Luckily it wasn't deep and I was soon pulled
out.

I cycled a lot when I was at school, as it was the only way to get around
without relying on a parent to drive me. However, when I was sixteen I got a
motor bike and stopped cycling. When I was about 30 I decided to buy a road
bike and got back into cycling. I was living in the Peak District in the bottom
of a valley, so getting anywhere involved cycling up a hill, although journeys
home were much easier. I was climbing regularly at the time, so was quite
fit. However, I soon discovered that cycling uses a whole different set of
muscles. A few years later, I moved to a different village which was at the top
of a hill about 1000ft above sea level. The start of each ride was a nice down
hill coast. However, getting back home was hard work.

Twenty years ago we moved back to the flat lands of Cheshire. However, even in
Cheshire there are a few lumpy bits.
